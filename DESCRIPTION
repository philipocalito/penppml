Description: A set of tools that enables efficient estimation of penalized 
    Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood regressions, using lasso or ridge penalties, for models 
    that feature one or more sets of high-dimensional fixed effects. The methodology is based on 
    Breinlich, Corradi, Rocha, Ruta, Santos Silva, and Zylkin (2021) <http://hdl.handle.net/10986/35451> 
    and takes advantage of the method of alternating projections of Gaure (2013) 
    <doi:10.1016/j.csda.2013.03.024> for dealing with HDFE, as well as 
    the coordinate descent algorithm of Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani (2010) 
    <doi:10.18637/jss.v033.i01> for fitting lasso regressions. The package is also able to carry out 
    cross-validation and to implement the plugin lasso of Belloni, Chernozhukov, Hansen and Kozbur (2016) 
    <doi:10.1080/07350015.2015.1102733>.
